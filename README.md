# BiteTut POC

BiteTut is an online course application that provides subscription service to learners with bite-sized tutorials.

Highlight of this application:

- Consumes content from the Contentful Delivery API
- Uses Stripe for the payment service to processes credit card payments and manage recurring payments
- Uses Serverless Framework to deploy AWS Lambda functions
- Protects API routes for authorized users using AWS Cognito
